# Configure Static Data on Dassault Platform

This folder contains detailed instructions for creating a 3D model of the static data on the Dassault platform. For that purpose, you will use the `City Referential` widget (Access to the widget is granted when you have the `City Planner` role). We recommend following this [guide](../configure_dassault_static_data/step_by_step_city_referential.md) first to familiarize yourselves with the `City Referential` widget.

The static data comprises of basemap, building, and tree data, as well as points of interest (POI: camera coordinates). To create a 3D model of the static data on the Dassault platform, you will have to upload, configure, and process these datasets in the following order:

1. [Basemap](../configure_dassault_static_data/basemap/steps_tobe_followed_basemap.md)
2. [Buildings](../configure_dassault_static_data/buildings/steps_tobe_followed_buildings.md)
3. [Trees](../configure_dassault_static_data/trees/steps_tobe_followed_trees.md)
4. [POI](../configure_dassault_static_data/cameras/steps_tobe_followed_cameras.md)
