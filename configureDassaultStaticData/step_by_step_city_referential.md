6. Using the `City Upload Assistant`, upload your basemap from online server to get an updated information and data. You can also upload the basemap from your laptop if it was previously downloaded.
   
> **NOTE:**
> If you used **"Connect to Server"**, you can use [BKG website](https://gdz.bkg.bund.de/index.php/default/open-data/wmts-basemapde-webraster-wmts-basemapde-webraster.html) for online maps. Copy the ["get capabilities"](https://basemap.de/dienste/wmts_capabilities_web_raster.xml) link and use it in the widget and then choose your desired map.
